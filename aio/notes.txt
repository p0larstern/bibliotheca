"add_book" function appends a book data at the end of "book.bin", we could have modified it to add the data
in a sorted manner(sorted a/c to "isbn") but that would have required much more computing power for reading
and writing data. if we would have appended data in a sorted manner our search algorithm may had been more
effective.

the layering of functions all the way from menu options to very basic performing tasks ones is present so
that the code is maintainable and ready to accomodate new features in future.
